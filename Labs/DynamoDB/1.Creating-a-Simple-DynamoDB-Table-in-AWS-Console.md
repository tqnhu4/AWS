## Guide: Creating a Simple DynamoDB Table in AWS Console

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a basic Amazon DynamoDB table directly in the AWS Management Console. This is an alternative to using Infrastructure as Code (like Terraform) and is useful for quickly setting up resources or for visual verification.

### **Level 1: Basic â€“ Getting Started with DynamoDB**

#### 1. **Create a Simple Table**

* Create a table named `Users` with `userId` as the primary key (`Partition Key`).
* **Lesson:** How to create a basic table and define its primary key.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions (AWS Management Console)

1.  **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**
    * Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your AWS account credentials.

2.  **Navigate to DynamoDB:**
    * In the AWS Console search bar at the top, type `DynamoDB` and select the "DynamoDB - NoSQL database" service from the results.

3.  **Start Creating a Table:**
    * On the DynamoDB dashboard, you will see a list of your existing tables (if any).
    * Click the **"Create table"** button.

4.  **Configure Table Settings:**

    * **Table name:** Enter `Users` (This is the name of your table).

    * **Partition key:**
        * Enter `userId` (This will be your primary key component, specifically the Partition Key).
        * **Data type:** Select `String` from the dropdown. *DynamoDB primary keys must have a defined data type (String, Number, or Binary).*

    * **Sort key (Optional):** Leave this blank. For this basic exercise, we are only defining a Partition Key. A Sort Key would be added later for composite primary keys.

    * **Table settings:**
        * For this basic exercise, you can choose "Default settings". This typically uses "On-demand" capacity mode, which means you pay for what you use, and automatically enables encryption at rest. This is generally a good choice for getting started and for unpredictable workloads.

    * **Tags (Optional):**
        * Scroll down to the "Tags" section. While optional, it's a best practice to tag your resources for organization and cost tracking.
        * Click "Add tag".
        * For **Key**, enter `Name`. For **Value**, enter `UsersTable`.
        * Click "Add tag" again. For **Key**, enter `Project`. For **Value**, enter `DynamoDBBasic`.

5.  **Create the Table:**
    * Review your settings.
    * Click the **"Create table"** button at the bottom of the page.

6.  **Monitor Table Creation:**
    * You will be redirected to the "Tables" list.
    * Your new `Users` table will appear with a "Status" of **"Creating"**.
    * Wait a few moments (usually less than a minute) until the "Status" changes to **"Active"**.

7.  **Verify Your Table:**
    * Once the table status is "Active", click on the `Users` table name.
    * On the table details page, you can review its configuration:
        * Under the "Details" tab, verify the "Table name" is `Users`.
        * Under "Primary key", confirm it shows `userId (Partition key)` with a data type of `String`.
        * Under "Capacity mode", it should show "On-demand".

### Congratulations!

You have successfully created a simple DynamoDB table named `Users` with `userId` as its Partition Key using the AWS Management Console. You now understand the fundamental steps of provisioning a basic DynamoDB table.

**Next Steps (Optional):**

* **Explore Items:** Click on the **"Explore table items"** tab within your `Users` table. You can then click "Create item" to add some sample data to your table.
* **Delete Table:** When you are done experimenting, it's good practice to delete resources to avoid unexpected charges.
    * Go back to the "Tables" list.
    * Select the `Users` table by checking the box next to its name.
    * Click the **"Delete"** button.
    * Confirm the deletion by typing `delete` in the confirmation box and clicking "Delete table".
