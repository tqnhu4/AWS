## Guide: Scanning an Entire DynamoDB Table in AWS Console

This guide will demonstrate how to perform a full table scan on your `Users` table using the AWS Management Console. The `Scan` operation reads every item in the table (or a secondary index) and then filters the results to return only the values that match the specified condition.

**Important Note about `Scan`:**
While easy to use, `Scan` operations are generally less efficient than `Query` operations, especially for large tables, because they consume more read capacity units and can take longer to complete. They should be used sparingly in production environments, typically for small tables or when you need to retrieve all items for analytical purposes.

### **Level 1: Basic â€“ Getting Started with DynamoDB**

#### 4. **Scan Entire Table**

* Retrieve all users in the `Users` table.
* **Lesson:** `Scan`.

---

### Prerequisites

* You have successfully completed "Lesson 2: Add Data to the Table" and have an active DynamoDB table named `Users` with at least some items (e.g., `user001` through `user005`).

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions (AWS Management Console)

1.  **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**
    * Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.

2.  **Navigate to DynamoDB:**
    * In the AWS Console search bar, type `DynamoDB` and select the service.

3.  **Go to Your Table's Items:**
    * In the DynamoDB dashboard, click on **"Tables"** in the left-hand navigation.
    * Click on your `Users` table.
    * Click on the **"Explore table items"** tab.

4.  **Initiate a "Scan" Operation:**
    * On the "Explore table items" page, you will see a dropdown menu labeled "Scan" or "Query" at the top (it usually defaults to "Scan").
    * Ensure the dropdown is set to **"Scan"**.
    * Below that, you might see an option for "Filter". For a full table scan, **do not add any filters**. Leave it blank or select "No filter".

5.  **Execute the "Scan" Request:**
    * Click the **"Run"** button (or "Scan" button, depending on the console version) next to the "Scan" dropdown.

6.  **View All Retrieved Items:**
    * The console will display all items currently present in your `Users` table. You should see all 5 users (`user001` through `user005`) that you added in Lesson 2.

    *You might also see options for "Load more" if your table contains more items than the console displays on a single page.*

### Congratulations!

You have successfully performed a full table scan on your DynamoDB `Users` table using the AWS Management Console. This demonstrates how to retrieve all data in your table using the `Scan` operation.

**Next Steps (Optional):**

* **Experiment with Filters (Advanced Scan):**
    * On the "Explore table items" tab, change the "Filter" dropdown from "No filter" to "Add filter".
    * Choose an attribute (e.g., `name`), select an operator (e.g., `begins_with`), and enter a value (e.g., `A`).
    * Click "Run" again. You will see only the items that match your filter (e.g., `Alice`). This is still a `Scan` operation, but with a filter applied *after* reading all items.
* **Clean Up:** Remember to delete your `Users` table when you are finished to avoid incurring charges. Go to the "Tables" list, select `Users`, click "Delete", and confirm.
