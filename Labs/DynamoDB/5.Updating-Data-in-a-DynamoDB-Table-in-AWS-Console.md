## Guide: Updating Data in a DynamoDB Table in AWS Console

This guide will show you how to modify the attributes of an existing item in your `Users` table directly within the AWS Management Console. This operation is analogous to the `UpdateItem` API call in DynamoDB, allowing you to change, add, or remove attributes for a specific item identified by its primary key.

-----

### **Level 1: Basic â€“ Getting Started with DynamoDB**

#### 5\. **Update Data**

  * Update the `email` of the user with `userId = user001` (or any `userId` you previously added).
  * **Lesson:** `UpdateItem`.

-----

### Prerequisites

  * You have successfully completed "Lesson 2: Add Data to the Table" and have an active DynamoDB table named `Users` with items, including `user001`.

-----

### Step-by-Step Instructions (AWS Management Console)

1.  **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**

      * Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.

2.  **Navigate to DynamoDB:**

      * In the AWS Console search bar, type `DynamoDB` and select the service.

3.  **Go to Your Table's Items:**

      * In the DynamoDB dashboard, click on **"Tables"** in the left-hand navigation.
      * Click on your `Users` table.
      * Click on the **"Explore table items"** tab.

4.  **Locate and Select the Item to Update:**

      * Find the row corresponding to `userId = user001` in the list of items.
      * Click the **checkbox** next to `user001` to select the item.

5.  **Initiate "Edit item" Operation:**

      * Once the item is selected, click the **"Actions"** dropdown menu.
      * Select **"Edit item"**.

6.  **Modify the Attribute:**

      * You will see the item's data displayed in an editor (either JSON or form-based).
      * Locate the `email` attribute.
      * Change its value from `"alice@example.com"` to a new email, for example, `"alice.updated@example.com"`.
      * You can directly edit the value in the text field or JSON editor.

    *If you are using the JSON editor, it would look something like this:*

    ```json
    {
      "userId": "user001",
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice.updated@example.com"
    }
    ```

    *If you are using the form view, simply type the new email in the value field next to `email`.*

7.  **Save the Changes:**

      * Click the **"Save changes"** button at the bottom of the editor.

8.  **Verify the Update:**

      * You will be taken back to the "Explore table items" page.
      * The list will now reflect the updated email address for `user001`. You can also click on `user001` to view its details and confirm the change.

### Congratulations\!

You have successfully updated an item in your DynamoDB `Users` table using the AWS Management Console. This demonstrates how to modify existing data using an operation analogous to `UpdateItem`.

-----

**Next Steps (Optional):**

  * **Add a new attribute:** While editing an item, you can also click the "+" button to add an entirely new attribute (e.g., `phone` and its value).
  * **Delete an attribute:** While editing an item, you can click the "X" or "Remove" button next to an attribute to delete it from the item.
  * **Clean Up:** Remember to delete your `Users` table when you are finished to avoid incurring charges. Go to the "Tables" list, select `Users`, click "Delete", and confirm.
