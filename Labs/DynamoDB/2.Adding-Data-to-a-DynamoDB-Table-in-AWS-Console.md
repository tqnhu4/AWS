## Guide: Adding Data to a DynamoDB Table in AWS Console

This guide will show you how to add data (items) to your DynamoDB table directly in the AWS Management Console. We'll demonstrate both adding items one by one and adding multiple items at once using the console's "Batch write" feature, which mimics the `PutItem` and `BatchWriteItem` operations respectively.

-----

### **Level 1: Basic â€“ Getting Started with DynamoDB**

#### 2\. **Add Data to the Table**

  * Add 5 users with the attributes: `userId`, `name`, `email`.
  * **Lesson:** `PutItem` (single item insertion), `BatchWriteItem` (multiple item insertion).

-----

### Prerequisites

  * You have successfully completed "Lesson 1: Creating a Simple Table" and have an active DynamoDB table named `Users` with `userId` as its Partition Key.

-----

### Step-by-Step Instructions (AWS Management Console)

1.  **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**

      * Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.

2.  **Navigate to DynamoDB:**

      * In the AWS Console search bar, type `DynamoDB` and select the service.

3.  **Go to Your Table's Items:**

      * In the DynamoDB dashboard, click on **"Tables"** in the left-hand navigation.
      * Click on your `Users` table (the one you created in the previous lesson).
      * Click on the **"Explore table items"** tab. This is where you can view, add, and manage data in your table.

-----

#### Method 1: Adding a Single Item (Simulating `PutItem`)

We will add the first two users one by one.

1.  **Click "Create item":**

      * On the "Explore table items" page, click the **"Create item"** button.

2.  **Enter Item Data for User 1:**

      * You will see a JSON editor or a form (depending on your console settings). It should already have the `userId` field.
      * **For `userId`:** Enter `"user001"` (Make sure to include quotes if it's in JSON format, or just type if it's a form).
      * **Add `name` attribute:**
          * Click the **"+"** button next to the `userId` field (or the "Add new attribute" button if it's a form).
          * Select **"Append"** -\> **"String"**.
          * For the new attribute **Name**, enter `name`.
          * For the **Value**, enter `"Alice"` (with quotes).
      * **Add `email` attribute:**
          * Click the **"+"** button again.
          * Select **"Append"** -\> **"String"**.
          * For the new attribute **Name**, enter `email`.
          * For the **Value**, enter `"alice@example.com"` (with quotes).

    *Your item should look something like this in JSON format:*

    ```json
    {
      "userId": "user001",
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
    ```

3.  **Save the Item:**

      * Click the **"Create item"** button at the bottom.
      * You will be taken back to the "Explore table items" page, and `user001` should now be listed.

4.  **Add User 2 (Repeat PutItem):**

      * Click **"Create item"** again.
      * **For `userId`:** Enter `"user002"`.
      * **Add `name`:** Enter `"Bob"`.
      * **Add `email`:** Enter `"bob@example.com"`.
      * Click **"Create item"**.
      * Now you should see both `user001` and `user002` in the table.

#### Method 2: Adding Multiple Items (Simulating `BatchWriteItem`)

We will add the remaining three users using the "Batch write" feature. This is efficient when you have many items to add or modify.

1.  **Click "Batch write items":**

      * On the "Explore table items" page, click the **"Actions"** dropdown menu.
      * Select **"Batch write items"**.

2.  **Add Items for User 3, 4, and 5:**

      * You will see an interface to add multiple items, typically by providing JSON data for each.
      * **Item 1 (User 3):**
          * Click **"Add item"**.
          * In the JSON editor that appears for the new item, enter:
        <!-- end list -->
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "user003",
          "name": "Charlie",
          "email": "charlie@example.com"
        }
        ```
      * **Item 2 (User 4):**
          * Click **"Add item"** again.
          * In the new JSON editor, enter:
        <!-- end list -->
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "user004",
          "name": "Diana",
          "email": "diana@example.com"
        }
        ```
      * **Item 3 (User 5):**
          * Click **"Add item"** again.
          * In the new JSON editor, enter:
        <!-- end list -->
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "user005",
          "name": "Eve",
          "email": "eve@example.com"
        }
        ```

3.  **Confirm Batch Write:**

      * Click the **"Batch write"** button at the bottom.
      * The console will process the items. You should see a success message.

4.  **Verify All 5 Users:**

      * You will be taken back to the "Explore table items" page.
      * You should now see all 5 users (`user001` through `user005`) listed in your `Users` table.

### Congratulations\!

You have successfully added data to your DynamoDB `Users` table using both single item insertion (mimicking `PutItem`) and batch item insertion (mimicking `BatchWriteItem`) via the AWS Management Console. You now know how to populate your DynamoDB tables with data\!

-----

**Next Steps (Optional):**

  * **View Item Details:** Click on any `userId` (e.g., `user001`) in the "Explore table items" list to view its full details.
  * **Edit Items:** While viewing an item's details, you can click "Edit" to modify its attributes.
  * **Delete Items:** Select one or more items using the checkboxes and click the "Delete" button from the "Actions" dropdown to remove them.
  * **Clean Up:** Remember to delete your `Users` table when you are finished to avoid incurring charges. Go to the "Tables" list, select `Users`, click "Delete", and confirm.
