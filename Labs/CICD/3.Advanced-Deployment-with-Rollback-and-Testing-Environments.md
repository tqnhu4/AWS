## **Level 3: Advanced Deployment with Rollback and Testing Environments**

**Objective:** Build a more sophisticated CI/CD pipeline including automated testing, manual approval, and automatic/manual rollback capabilities. Deploy to multiple environments or include more in-depth health checks.

**Key Differences from Level 2:**

  * **Added Test Stage in CodeBuild:** Runs automated tests.
  * **Added Manual Approval Stage in CodePipeline:** Pauses the pipeline for review before deployment.
  * **Use of Load Balancer and Health Checks with CodeDeploy:** Ensures the application is healthy before traffic cutover.
  * **Integration with CloudWatch Alarms for Automatic Rollback:** Automatically reverts on post-deployment issues.
  * **Optional Blue/Green Deployment with EC2:** Requires two sets of servers, more complex than In-place.

### **Level 3A: Add Test Stage & Manual Approval**

**Continue with the Node.js application from Level 2.**

#### **Step 1: Update Application and `buildspec.yml`**

1.  **Add a test script to `package.json` (if not already there):**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-nodejs-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A simple Node.js app for CI/CD demo",
      "main": "app.js",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js",
        "test": "node test.js" # <-- Add a real test script
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.18.2"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Create `test.js` (e.g., a simple test):**

    ```javascript
    // test.js
    console.log("Running application tests...");
    const assert = require('assert');

    // Simulate a simple test
    function runTests() {
        try {
            assert.strictEqual(1 + 1, 2, 'Test 1: 1 + 1 should be 2');
            console.log('Test 1 passed.');

            // Simulate a failing test to check rollback
            // assert.strictEqual(1 + 1, 3, 'Test 2: This test is designed to fail!');
            // console.log('Test 2 passed.');

            console.log('All tests passed successfully!');
            process.exit(0); // Exit with code 0 if all tests pass
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Test failed: ${error.message}`);
            process.exit(1); // Exit with code 1 if any test fails
        }
    }

    runTests();
    ```

    *Note:* To test rollback, you can uncomment the `assert.strictEqual(1 + 1, 3, ...)` line to intentionally make the test fail.

3.  **Update `buildspec.yml` to run tests:**

    ```yaml
    version: 0.2

    phases:
      install:
        commands:
          - echo Installing Node.js...
          - curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash -
          - yum install -y nodejs
          - echo Installing application dependencies...
          - npm install --prefix . # Assuming code is at the repo root
      pre_build: # New stage to run tests before main build
        commands:
          - echo Running pre-build checks/tests...
          - npm test
      build:
        commands:
          - echo Building...
          # No complex build step for Node.js, just packaging.
      post_build:
        commands:
          - echo Build completed.
    artifacts:
      files:
        - '**/*'
    ```

4.  **Commit and push to GitHub.**

#### **Step 2: Configure CodePipeline (Add Stages)**

1.  **Edit your `MyNodejsApp-Pipeline`:**
      * Go to the CodePipeline Console, select your pipeline.
      * Click "Edit".
      * **Add a Test Stage:**
          * Click "Add stage" after the "Build" stage.
          * **Stage name:** `Test`
          * Click "Add action group".
          * **Action name:** `RunTests`
          * **Action provider:** `AWS CodeBuild`
          * **Input artifacts:** Select the output artifact from the "Build" stage.
          * **Project name:** You can create a new CodeBuild project solely for testing (e.g., `MyNodejsApp-Test`) or reuse `MyNodejsApp-Build` if your `buildspec.yml` handles tests effectively. If reusing, ensure `buildspec.yml` exits with an error code if tests fail.
          * Click "Done".
      * **Add a Manual Approval Stage:**
          * Click "Add stage" after the "Test" stage.
          * **Stage name:** `Approval`
          * Click "Add action group".
          * **Action name:** `ManualApproval`
          * **Action provider:** `Manual approval`
          * You can add an SNS topic to send approval notifications.
          * Click "Done".
      * **Save the pipeline changes.**

#### **Step 3: Test the Pipeline with Testing and Approval**

1.  **Trigger the Pipeline:** Commit a small change to GitHub.
2.  **Observe the Test Stage:** If tests pass, the pipeline will proceed to the "Approval" stage. If tests fail (e.g., you uncommented the failing `assert.strictEqual` line), the "Test" stage will fail, and the pipeline will stop.
3.  **Observe the Approval Stage:** The pipeline will pause here. You'll need to go to the CodePipeline Console, click "Review" on the Approval stage, and then "Approve" or "Reject" to continue or stop the pipeline.

### **Level 3B: Integrate Load Balancer & Health Checks with CodeDeploy**

**Objective:** Utilize an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with CodeDeploy to perform advanced health checks before routing traffic, enhancing reliability.

**Requirements:**

  * At least 2 EC2 instances running the application (for better rolling updates or blue/green).
  * An Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Target Groups.

#### **Step 1: Prepare EC2 Environment and ALB**

1.  **Launch 2 EC2 Instances:** Similar to Level 2, but ensure both have Node.js and the CodeDeploy Agent installed.

      * Attach the same IAM Role (with CodeDeploy permissions) to both.
      * Attach the same Security Group(s) to both.

2.  **Create Target Groups in EC2:**

      * Go to the EC2 Console -\> Target Groups.
      * Click "Create target group".
      * **Choose a target type:** `Instances`
      * **Target group name:** `my-nodejs-app-tg`
      * **Protocol:** `HTTP`, **Port:** `3000` (your application's port)
      * **VPC:** Select your VPC.
      * **Health checks:**
          * **Protocol:** `HTTP`
          * **Path:** `/` (or `/health` if your application has a specific health check endpoint).
          * Configure other parameters (Interval, Timeout, Healthy threshold, Unhealthy threshold) as appropriate.
      * Click "Next", then select your 2 EC2 instances and "Include as pending below".
      * Click "Create target group".

3.  **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):**

      * Go to the EC2 Console -\> Load Balancers.
      * Click "Create Load Balancer" -\> "Application Load Balancer".
      * **Load balancer name:** `MyNodejsAppALB`
      * **Scheme:** `Internet-facing` (or `internal` depending on your needs).
      * **VPC:** Select your VPC.
      * **Availability Zones:** Select at least 2 AZs and corresponding subnets.
      * **Security Groups:** Create or select an SG that allows inbound HTTP (port 80) traffic from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
      * **Listeners and routing:**
          * **Protocol:** `HTTP`, **Port:** `80`
          * **Default action:** Forward to your `my-nodejs-app-tg` (Target Group you just created).
      * Click "Create load balancer".

#### **Step 2: Update CodeDeploy Deployment Group**

1.  **Edit your `MyNodejsApp-DeploymentGroup`:**
      * Go to the CodeDeploy Console -\> Applications -\> `MyNodejsApp` -\> `MyNodejsApp-DeploymentGroup`.
      * Click "Edit".
      * **Load balancer:**
          * Check "Enable load balancing".
          * **Load balancers:** Select your `MyNodejsAppALB`.
          * **Target groups:** Select your `my-nodejs-app-tg`.
      * **Reroute traffic after successful deployment:** Choose "Immediately" or configure a wait time for manual verification.
      * **Deployment style:** `In-place` is still suitable.
      * **Deployment configuration:** `CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce` (If you have multiple instances, consider `OneAtATime` or `HalfAtATime` for rolling updates).
      * **Rollback configuration:** Check "Enable rollback".
      * Click "Save changes".

#### **Step 3: Adjust Scripts in `scripts/` (if necessary)**

  * With an ALB, ensure your application consistently listens on a fixed port (e.g., 3000).
  * CodeDeploy's hooks (`ApplicationStop`, `ApplicationStart`) will work well with this setup.

#### **Step 4: Test Deployment with ALB and Health Checks**

1.  **Trigger the Pipeline:** Commit a small change to GitHub.
2.  **Observe the Deploy Stage:**
      * CodeDeploy will begin deploying to each instance (if you chose `OneAtATime`).
      * It will deregister the instance from the ALB Target Group, deploy, then re-register it.
      * The ALB will perform Health Checks. If an instance becomes unhealthy after deployment, CodeDeploy will stop or roll back based on configuration.
      * You can monitor the Health Status of your instances in the Target Group section of the EC2 Console.
3.  **Access Your Application:** Use the **ALB's DNS name** instead of the EC2 instance's IP. `http://<ALB_DNS_Name>`

### **Level 3C: Automatic Rollback with CloudWatch Alarms (Advanced)**

**Objective:** Configure a CloudWatch Alarm to automatically trigger a CodeDeploy rollback if monitoring metrics cross a threshold after deployment.

#### **Step 1: Configure a CloudWatch Alarm**

1.  **Ensure CloudWatch Logs (Optional but Recommended):**

      * Your application on EC2 should ideally send logs to CloudWatch Logs (e.g., via the CloudWatch Agent).
      * Alternatively, you can create a metric filter on CodeDeploy Agent logs or system logs if you detect errors.

2.  **Create a CloudWatch Alarm:**

      * Go to the CloudWatch Console -\> Alarms -\> "Create alarm".
      * **Select metric:** Choose a suitable metric to monitor your application's health or infrastructure.
          * **Example 1 (Error Rate):** If your application logs errors, you can create a Metric Filter on your log group to count errors and create an alarm when the error count exceeds a threshold.
          * **Example 2 (CPU Utilization):** Monitor the CPU of your EC2 instances. Select `EC2` -\> `Per-Instance Metrics` -\> Choose the `CPUUtilization` metric for your instances.
          * **Example 3 (HTTP 5xx errors from ALB):** Monitor `HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count` from your ALB. Select `ApplicationELB` -\> `Per-Target Group Metrics`.
      * **Conditions:**
          * `Threshold type`: `Static`
          * `Whenever CPUUtilization is`: `Greater/Less than` a certain threshold.
          * Configure for a specific duration (e.g., 5 consecutive minutes).
      * **Next (Configure actions):**
          * **Notification:** You can configure an SNS topic for notifications.
          * **EC2 action:** Skip.
          * **Auto Scaling action:** Skip.
      * **Next (Add to alarm):**
          * **Alarm name:** `MyNodejsApp-HighCPUAlarm` (or a suitable name).
          * **Alarm description:** Provide a detailed description.
      * Click "Create alarm".

#### **Step 2: Update CodeDeploy Deployment Group**

1.  **Edit your `MyNodejsApp-DeploymentGroup` (again):**
      * Go to the CodeDeploy Console -\> Applications -\> `MyNodejsApp` -\> `MyNodejsApp-DeploymentGroup`.
      * Click "Edit".
      * **Advanced options -\> Rollbacks:**
          * Check "Enable rollback".
          * **CloudWatch alarms:** Select the alarm you just created (`MyNodejsApp-HighCPUAlarm`).
      * Click "Save changes".

#### **Step 3: Test Automatic Rollback**

1.  **Trigger the Pipeline:** Push a new version of your application to GitHub.
2.  **Monitor Deployment:**
      * Once CodeDeploy begins deploying the new version, try to cause the application on the new EC2 instances to fail (e.g., by using the `stress` command to spike CPU, or by modifying code to intentionally crash).
      * `sudo apt install stress` or `sudo yum install stress`
      * Run a stress command: `stress -c 4` (creates 4 CPU-stressing processes)
3.  **Observe CloudWatch Alarm:** You'll see the alarm state change to `ALARM`.
4.  **Observe CodeDeploy:** CodeDeploy will detect the alarm and automatically initiate a rollback, reverting your application to the previous stable version.

### 🧹 **Cleanup**

To avoid incurring unexpected charges, remember to clean up all the AWS resources you've created after completing your experiments:

1.  **Delete CodePipeline:** Go to the **CodePipeline** console -\> **Pipelines**. Select all your pipelines (e.g., `MyStaticWebApp-Pipeline`, `MyNodejsApp-Pipeline`) and click **Delete**. This will also delete associated S3 artifact buckets.
2.  **Delete CodeBuild Projects:** Go to the **CodeBuild** console -\> **Build projects**. Select all your build projects (e.g., `MyStaticWebApp-Build`, `MyNodejsApp-Build`) and click **Delete build project**.
3.  **Delete CodeDeploy Applications:** Go to the **CodeDeploy** console -\> **Applications**. Select all your applications (e.g., `MyStaticWebApp`, `MyNodejsApp`) and click **Delete application**. This will also delete their deployment groups.
4.  **Terminate EC2 Instances:** Go to the **EC2** console -\> **Instances**. Select all the EC2 instances you launched and click **Instance state** -\> **Terminate instance**.
5.  **Delete EC2 Load Balancers & Target Groups:** Go to the **EC2** console -\> **Load Balancers** and **Target Groups**. Delete your ALB and associated Target Groups.
6.  **Delete ECR Repositories (if used):** If you experimented with Docker images, delete your repositories from the **ECR** console.
7.  **Delete S3 Buckets:** Check and delete any S3 buckets you manually created (e.g., for build artifacts).
8.  **Delete CloudWatch Log Groups & Alarms:** Go to the **CloudWatch** console -\> **Log groups** and **Alarms**. Delete any log groups and alarms you created.
9.  **Delete IAM Roles:** Go to the **IAM** console -\> **Roles**. Delete all the IAM Roles you created for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and EC2.
