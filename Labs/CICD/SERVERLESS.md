# ðŸš€ Automated CI/CD for Serverless Applications (Lambda, API Gateway, S3/CloudFront)

This guide will walk you through building an automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and GitHub, specifically for **serverless applications**.

**Important Note:** For serverless applications, managing resources often involves **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. In this guide, we'll use **AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)**, an open-source framework built on AWS CloudFormation, to define our serverless resources.
