# ðŸš€ Automated CI/CD Deployment to EC2 with GitHub, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy

This guide will walk you through setting up an automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS services (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy) and GitHub, deploying your applications to EC2 instances. We'll progress through three levels of complexity, from a simple static website to a more robust application with advanced features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overall Goal:

Build an automated CI/CD pipeline that triggers deployments to EC2 instances whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.
