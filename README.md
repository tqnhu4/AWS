## [ðŸ§ª Projects](./Projects/README.md)

- Independent assignments that require you to integrate knowledge from multiple lessons and labs. 
- Design, implement, and troubleshoot end-to-end solutions using various AWS services. 
- Projects encourage problem-solving, critical thinking, and best practices in cloud architecture.
